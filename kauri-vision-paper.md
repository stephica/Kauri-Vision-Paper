# Welcome to Kauri – Decentral Ethereum support

Kauri is a project to build a decentralized technical support network for the Ethereum ecosystem. Its goal is to combine the advantages of open, community-run forums with the quality and reliability of professional paid support. Run by the community, it will offer users broad choice – from a free, open knowledge base through paid support queries and longer-term support arrangements. Anyone can join the platform and provide their expertise, potentially earning money through bounties, tips and paid jobs.

In this paper we outline the Kauri vision and give a quick overview of what the platform will look like and how it will be governed. More about Kauri, including the complete technical details can be found, when finished, at [www.kauri.io](www.kauri.io).

"The Kauri platform is named after the famed Kauri tree in New Zealand. Kauri forests are among the most ancient in the world, and in the past the extremely strong Kauri wood has been prized for both its beauty and utility. 

Today it serves us as a symbol of our ambition to build a useful, long-lasting, firmly grounded and ever-expanding tree of knowledge for the Ethereum community."

# Tree of knowledge

Kauri is a fully decentralized marketplace that brings together those seeking software support services with those offering it. Initially geared to Ethereum developers and App users, the technology and methodology we employ has the potential for application in any support or other knowledge-based services setting. 

Built on the Ethereum network, Kauri’s goal is to provide curated access to quality support and knowledge bases and – through a tokenized model – reward the contributions of those who supply their expertise as well as help govern the platform.

While users on Kauri can profit from a constantly growing, freely available knowledge base, for more specific, complex or urgent issues, they can also pay for support by posting requests and offering to pay a fee. Users and providers can also negotiate directly with each other for private support arrangements and service level agreements.

In this way Kauri bridges the gap between fully community-based and 100% commercial solutions, offering both users and service providers far more flexibility than either of these existing models can. 

Kauri is a non-profit, fully decentralized, community-driven platform. It contains mechanisms to ensure quality and protection for users, payment and equal access to potential jobs for providers, and incentives for community members to take an active role in governing and ensuring the continued attractiveness of the platform.

## Human-centric consensus

Kauri aims to fill an important need for the Ethereum community in a manner appropriate and attractive to all members – from individual developers to enterprise users. It can play an important role in growing the community's collective knowledge. It also provides a means for anyone with domain knowledge to become a provider and so monetize their expertise without having to become part of a larger organization. We think this will catalyze the growth of a large community of Ethereum support providers.

Kauri's hybrid solution to open source software support, once refined and proven successful,  can serve as a model for other open source projects with similar challenges. We also believe Kauri can serve the blockchain community as an exercise in how to build tokenized, decentralized markets for services generally.

Unlike consensus around clearly quantifiable data like a cryptotoken or smart contract, in the world of service provision many subjective, human elements are at play. What to do if users unclearly or ambiguously describe their problem? How can we handle good faith disagreements between users and providers on what constitutes an acceptable solution? Absent a central authority, how can users judge the potential quality of a provider? And absent such an authority, how can we keep the platform free of incompetent or untrustworthy providers? 

Decentralized service markets require, along with value and informational-based consensus mechanisms, what we might call human-centric consensus and governance mechanisms. Kauri is embarking on a maiden voyage to explore and solve many of these incentive problems. We think the solutions we are developing can be of interest to the community in this broader context too, and we will look to collaborate as openly as possible on charting these new waters.

# Using Kauri

Kauri is an online knowledge and support marketplace. For those using it, it will resemble any other similar marketplace. A participant can login and then, depending on his or her role, carry out any number of different activities.

One can gain a greater understanding of how Kauri will work by viewing the platform from the perspective of its different actors. We envision four main "roles" on Kauri (though it is possible for a single person to take on more than role). These can be categorised as follows:

Market participants:

* **User:** Someone who comes to Kauri looking for answers to technical questions or for more elaborate technical support.

* **Provider****:** Someone (or some entity) on the platform that offers support.

Platform governors:

 

* **Token holder:** A holder of a Kauri token. Token holders play an important role in the governance of the platform by staking providers and adjudicating membership challenges.

* **Arbitrator:** Someone who is involved in adjudicating disputes around individual support requests.

## Market participants

### Users

Users of the Kauri platform will have access to three kinds of support: self-service, public request and private request. The most appropriate support will depend on the kind of user and the nature of their question. There are three basic options:

* **Self-service knowledge base.** Kauri’s knowledge base contains articles and previously answered questions. All users will have free access to this knowledge base, and this will likely be their first stop when searching for answers. As public requests are resolved, the chosen answers are automatically migrated to the knowledge base, so that it becomes richer over time. 

* **Public request. **If users cannot find the answer in the knowledge base, they can turn to the community for support by submitting a public request. Users fill in a form describing their issue. They may also add a bounty – and other users who think the question is important can add to that bounty. As community members can sort questions by size of bounty, this should encourage quicker responses and higher quality answers. Once responses are received, the user chooses the best one in his or her opinion and the winning provider receives a portion of the bounty. Other users who find existing answers useful – whether "winning" answers or not – can voluntarily add payment to the answer in the form of a “tip”.

* **Private request.** Users can also submit private requests, which is analog to hiring a freelancer to solve a problem. Private requests can be submitted to the market for anyone to bid on, or they can be submitted directly to one or more chosen providers. Once submitted, users can review the offers, choose a provider and negotiate the fee. This generates a smart contract which holds the fee in escrow. When the work is completed to the user’s satisfaction, the smart contract pays the fee to the provider.

### Providers

Providers are those on Kauri who provide some sort of support service, be it by contributing to the knowledge base or responding to public or private requests.

Anyone with the requisite expertise, be it independent Ethereum or Dapp developers, super users, product teams, or even established support organizations, can become a provider. There are a number of incentives to do so, chief among these the opportunity to monetize expertise through earning bounties, tips or fees. 

There are two types of providers.

* **Contributor. **Someone who voluntarily contributes knowledge to Kauri.

* **Official provider****. **A registered, staked provider of support services, generally for a fee.

A** contributor **is** **someone who contributes information to the Kauri knowledge base either by posting articles, answering public queries or helping to curate knowledge base content. Anyone can become a contributor simply by signing up to the platform. Contributors are not explicitly paid. In an effort to incentivize quality free content, Kauri users can however choose to offer bounties or tips for content. It is therefore possible that contributors can earn money for their work. Quality control of contributions is maintained, among other things, through up- and downvoting by the community.

An** official provider** is a person or organization offering expertise and support on Kauri, generally for a fee. Official providers are able to contribute to the Kauri knowledge base as contributors do, but unlike contributors they are also able to respond to paid public and private requests, and to negotiate directly with users for support jobs, including longer-term support contracts. To become an official provider, an interested party must register as such and pay a minimum deposit. We describe the purpose and functioning of this "stake" in more detail below. 

![image alt text](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NDbY9K1LVrY9pLijiqnoQ3CiQSH04SGaLNJc92A0UbIGRghVFqFeqvRVwByOgW7d1RgZSj78gtaG5OFp5kT4=w2486-h1268-rw)

## Kauri trust model

As with any marketplace, Kauri requires robust "trust" mechanisms to be successful. Ideally these mechanisms would ensure fairness as well as increase confidence in the network by decreasing the “blind trust” required when entering into a service relationship. This benefits all participants, especially smaller providers who cannot invest in their brand and balance sheet. 

The Kauri trust model can be described in terms of three basic elements:

* **Staking.** A means to give all providers, regardless of size, a "balance sheet" that acts among other things as security for the quality of work. 

* **Reputation.** Metrics that measure the behavior of all participants in the platform, for use in evaluating potential counterparties.

* **Governance.** Mechanisms to resolve disputes and, if needed, remove bad actors from the platform.

### Staking model

Providers who want to earn fees on the Kauri network have to be backed – or "staked" – by Kauri tokens. 

There are two sources for a stake. When people register on Kauri to become official providers, they must stake themselves by paying a minimum deposit in Kauri tokens. Once on the platform, others can choose to back them by adding Kauri tokens of their own to the stake. 

There is a strong incentive to do so. Kauri token holders who stake official providers are awarded a portion of that provider’s fees. This is done according to a predefined formula, and the system contains tweaks to ensure that stakes are broadly apportioned and do not accumulate with only a few parties. The intent is to ensure that all quality providers are backed by ample amounts of Kauri tokens. 

Why is that important?

Staking is a key element of the Kauri trust model because the stake – to which the provider does not have direct access, but whose size is public knowledge on the platform – plays the role of the provider's balance sheet. A balance sheet serves several purposes.

It provides the funds to indemnify users in the case of bad service, and so gives users reassurance that they can be made whole should they not receive the answer or service they were entitled to. The stake can also be used to pay damages in the case of gross negligence, incompetence or fraud. This "insurance" greatly increases confidence in the network. The stake is also always “at risk”: if a provider loses a dispute or has their membership revoked, part or all of the stake can be lost. That is an incentive for providers to provide good service, and for token holders to try and back quality providers.

In addition, staking is inherently an indication of reputation (see below). Users can assume that those providers with high stakes have earned the confidence of Kauri token holders. Users can therefore use a provider’s stake as an input in their evaluation of potential support partners.

By giving token holders incentives to stake as many quality providers as possible, we have a mechanism to ensure that all those who merit it have a sufficient balance sheet. In this way the platform is not dominated by well-heeled professionals, but provides an equal chance for all.

### Reputation model

Another important trust mechanism on Kauri is reputation, and the platform has a number of reputation metrics that can be "attached" to participants.

We have already seen that staking can be used as a reputation for providers. There are other metrics as well. These include, among others, up- and downvoting of individual answers or contributions, a participant’s dispute record, and various additional performance metrics for official providers. 

These reputation metrics incentivize quality work and provide flags for lower quality, incompetent or fraudulent actors. Using them, participants on the platform can more easily evaluate their current and potential counterparties.

### Governance model

Disputes are a natural part of any marketplace, as is the existence of incompetent or disreputable market participants. Governance mechanisms are therefore essential to a market’s healthy functioning. 

On Kauri, governance issues can arise in a number of different contexts. Users might find that the work done for them is shoddy or incomplete. Providers may find there are users who constantly complain of bad service when this has not been the case (so-called nuisance users). The community may find that there are actors whose behavior is detrimental to others and the platform, either through incompetence or malice. 

There are two main types of governance tasks on Kauri:

* **Membership challenges.** Attempts to revoke a members right to be on the platform. These are initiated and adjudicated by Kauri token holders.

* **Single request disputes**. Disagreements about a particular request or contract. These are adjudicated by special arbitrators.

#### Adjudicating membership challenges

Token holders are responsible for adjudicating membership challenges, either against users or providers:

* Token holders (individually or as part of a group) can initiate a member challenge

* Token holders can vote on a member challenge initiated by others

Token holders would initiate a member challenge if they observed members – either providers or users – that are problematic; members that for example are constantly involved in and losing disputes, or behaving in a clearly detrimental or fraudulent manner and so posing a danger to other market participants. 

To protect against frivolous membership challenges, the initiators of the challenge have to have some "skin in the game". For challenges against a provider they must post Kauri tokens equal to that provider’s stake. Challenges to user membership will require a minimum deposit yet to be determined. 

Once the challenge is made, it is put up for a vote to those token holders who were not part of the challenging group. The platform provides mechanisms for those who are voting to review the facts of the case before making their decision. Once the vote is held, the results are made public, and the decision - remove from platform or keep - is carried out.

If an official provider is removed from the platform, his or her stake is forfeit. As mentioned above, this provides incentives both for the provider to do good work, and for token holders to carefully vet the providers they back.

#### Adjudicating single request disputes

While we expect membership challenges to be the exception rather than the rule, there are likely to be regular disputes about individual requests or jobs. A user might receive a wrong answer or a provider might miss a deadline, for example, or a user might incorrectly or unclearly specify the work that needs to be done. 

If the user and provider cannot resolve the problem through direct dialog, then the issue is forwarded to arbitration. This will be carried out by special arbitrators. The exact mechanism is still being developed, but we anticipate – among other things for reasons of fairness – that the arbitrators will be external to the Kauri platform. 

The key part of arbitration is that here too there will be a certain sum "at risk": those who lose an arbitration case stand to forfeit tokens as well.

### Actors in equilibrium

In the introduction we said that a service platform like Kauri, if it is going to be truly decentralized, needs human-centric consensus and governance mechanisms. 

In our trust model, quality assurance and governance function without centralized control. They are based instead on the mechanics of reputation, economic rewards and penalties as worked out through the interactions of users, providers and token holders.

In this way we attain our goal of establishing an open source, community-run marketplace for support service provision – one that combines the best of the public, volunteer forum model and the paid commercial model, while avoiding their pitfalls.
